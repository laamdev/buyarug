          We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our

          such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of
          audience they want to target (for example, men in Manchester). We may
          make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us
          to comply with our advertisers&apos; wishes by displaying their
          advertisement to that target audience.

            <h3>Your cancellation and refund rights if you are a consumer</h3>
            <ol type='a'>
              <li>
                If you are a consumer, you have a legal right to cancel a
                Contract under the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling)
                Regulations 2000 during the period set out in clause 8.c. This
                means that during the relevant period if you change your mind or
                for any other reason you decide you do not want to keep a
                Product , you may notify us of your decision to cancel the
                Contract and receive a refund. Your right to a refund during
                this period is not affected by your payment having been made in
                advance. If you cancel after this period, you will not get a
                full refund. Advice about your legal right to cancel the
                Contract under these regulations is available from your local
                Citizens&apos; Advice Bureau or trading standards office.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, this cancellation right does not apply in the case of:
                <ul>
                  <li>any made-to-measure or custom-made products;</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Your legal right to cancel a Contract starts from the date of
                the Dispatch Confirmation, which is when the Contract between us
                is formed. You have a period of 7 working days in which you may
                cancel, starting from the day after the day you receive the
                Products or, in the case of services, from the date of the
                Dispatch Confirmation. Working days means that Saturdays,
                Sundays or public holidays are not included in this period.
              </li>
              <li>
                To cancel a Contract, you must contact us in writing by sending
                an email to info@buyarug.co.uk or by sending a letter to 91 Bean
                Oak Road, Wokingham, Berkshire, RG40 1RJ or please contact our
                Customer Services telephone line on 0800 028 1782. You may wish
                to keep a copy of your cancellation notification for your own
                records.
              </li>
              <li>
                You will receive a full refund of the price you paid for the
                Products. We will process the refund due to you as soon as
                possible and, in any case, within 30 calendar days of the day on
                which you gave us notice of cancellation as described in clause
                8.d. If you returned the Products to us because they were faulty
                or misdescribed, please see clause 8.f.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have returned the Products to us under this clause 8
                because they are faulty or misdescribed, we will refund the
                price of a defective Product in full, any applicable delivery
                charges, and any reasonable costs you incur in returning the
                item to us.
              </li>
              <li>
                The refund will be made to the credit card or debit card used by
                you to pay.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the Products were delivered to you:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    you must return the Products to us as soon as reasonably
                    practicable;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    unless the Products are faulty or not as described (in this
                    case, see clause 8.f), you will be responsible for the cost
                    of returning the Products to us;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    you have a legal obligation to keep the Products in your
                    possession and to take reasonable care of the Products while
                    they are in your possession.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Details of your legal right to cancel and an explanation of how
                to exercise it are provided in the Dispatch Confirmation.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a consumer, you will always have legal rights in relation to
                Products that are faulty or not as described. These legal rights
                are not affected by the returns policy in this clause 10 or
                these Terms. Advice about your legal rights is available from
                your local Citizens&apos; Advice Bureau or trading standards
                office.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you cancel an order for services under this clause 10 and we
                have already started work on your order by that time, you will
                need to pay us any costs we reasonably incurred in starting to
                fulfil the order, and this charge will be deducted from any
                refund that is due to you, or if no refund is due to you,
                invoiced to you. We will tell you what these costs are when you
                contact us.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the Products are services, once we have begun to provide the
                services to you, you may cancel the Contract with immediate
                effect by giving us written notice if:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    we break the Contract in any material way and we do not
                    correct or fix the situation within 14 days of you asking us
                    to in writing;

                  <li>
                    we change these Terms in accordance with this agreement to
                    your material disadvantage;
                  </li>
                  <li>we are affected by an Event Outside Our Control.</li>

                Outside Our Control. If we are unable to meet the estimated
                delivery date because of an Event Outside Our Control, we will

                You must not misuse the Site by knowingly introducing viruses,
                trojans, worms, logic bombs or other material which is malicious
                or technologically harmful. You must not attempt to gain

                this provision, you would commit a criminal offence under the
                Computer Misuse Act 1990 of the United Kingdom. We will report
                any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities and
                we will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing your
                identity to them. In the event of such a breach, your right to
                use the Site will cease immediately.

                We may transfer our rights and obligations under a Contract to
                another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or
                our obligations under these Terms. We will always notify you if
                this happens.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may transfer your rights or your obligations under these
                Terms to another person only if we agree in writing. However if
                you are a consumer and you have purchased a Product as a gift,
                you may transfer the benefit of the warranty in clause 16 to the
                recipient of the gift without needing to ask our consent.
              </li>
              <li>
                This contract is between you and us. No other person will have
                any rights to enforce any of its terms, whether under the
                Contracts (Rights of Third Parties Act) 1999 or otherwise.
                However, if you are a consumer, the recipient of your gift of a
                Product will have the benefit of the warranty at clause 16, but
                we and you will not need their consent to cancel or make any
                changes to these Terms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If
                any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are
                unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain
                in full force and effect.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations
                under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against
                you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have
                waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not
                have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default
                by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean
                that we will automatically waive any later default by you.

                We make no representation that the Site is appropriate or
                available for use outside England and Wales. If you access the
                Site from any other jurisdiction, you do so out of your own
                volition and you are responsible for compliance with all
                applicable laws.

                If you are a consumer, please note that these Terms are governed
                by English law. This means that a Contract and any dispute or
                claim arising out of or in connection with it will be governed
                by English law. You and we both agree to that the courts of
                England will have non-exclusive jurisdiction. However, if you
                are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring
                proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are resident of
                Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.

                If you are a business, these Terms are governed by English law.
                This means that a Contract, and any dispute or claim arising out
                of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation
                (including non-contractual disputes or claims), will be governed
                by English law. We both agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
                of the courts of England.
